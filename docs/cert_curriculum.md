# Data Analytics, Certificate (789.1)

If you began or will begin the A.S. before Fall 2021, you can choose to follow [the 789 version of the program](https://catalog.ccac.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=9&poid=2130&returnto=2207). There are two changes to that course progression you should be aware of: 
1. DAT-202 (renamed to "Advanced Analytic Methods") now has DAT-204 as a prerequisite
1. DAT-201 no longer exists, and instead you should take DAT-229. 

## Description:                              

This certificate prepares students for entry level positions in the field of data analytics or to augment their current job roles with computer-based data analytic skills. Data analytics involves data acquisition, cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis, applying tools to investigate inquiry questions and conveying data-backed conclusions clearly to decision makers.  Geared toward degree-holding students, the certificateâ€™s eight-course sequence prepares students with Python and R programming skills to build data pipelines connecting relational databases programming environments and data visualization tools.  

Upon successful completion of the program, the graduate will:
1) Apply programming tools to discover patterns and relationships in data sets.
2) Design data visualizations for exploratory analysis and persuasive communication.
3) Construct multi-step analytic tool chains through peer collaboration.
