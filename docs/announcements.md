# Announcements

We have a [Slack](https://ccac-data-analytics.slack.com) where we communicate in near-real-time (requires a CCAC email address to register). Any announcements we post here, we will also post there.

### 12/18/2020:

* A note for **anyone who might need DAT-202 in Fall 2021** (mostly **anyone who took DAT-102 in Spring 2020**): you need to take DAT-204 in Spring 2021. DAT-202 will still cover some advanced Pandas, because it's fun, but the course will be taught primarily in R from this point forward. (Since 202 is meant to be a spring-only course, we can't promise the fall session of it will run. We _can_ promise that, if the fall session does not run, the spring one will.)

* We need to make one modification to it before we can share the document publicly, but we did tally the results of the survey filled out by DAT students in Fall 2020. With a 75% response rate, you all seem to _vastly_ prefer remote (synchronous/Zoom) courses:
