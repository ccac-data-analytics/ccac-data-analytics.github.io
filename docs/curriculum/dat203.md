# DAT 203 - Data Visualization

Either DAT 203 OR DAT 241 is required for [A.S.](as_curriculum.md) and [Certificate](cert_curriculum.md)

**Credits:** 3 (Skills Lab Hours)

**Terms:** Fall only

**Pre-requisites:** DAT 129

## Description

In this course students explore the nuances associated with designing visual representations of quantitative information and implementing those plans using digital tools. As a project-based course, students investigate an inquiry question from inception through presentation. Students explore their inquiry questions by using data visualization as both an analytic tool and an aid to effective communication of data-backed conclusions.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of the course, the student will:
1. Critique existing data visualizations using design principles and best practices.
2. Design an inquiry project requiring the aggregation of several sources of data and visualization-supported analysis and communication.
3. Construct visualizations of time-series data using scripts written in Python or R.
4. Communicate data-backed claims supported by data visualizations.
