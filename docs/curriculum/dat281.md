# DAT 281 - Project in Data Analytics

Required for [A.S.](as_curriculum.md) and [Certificate](cert_curriculum.md). [Occasionally, another project-based course or a practicum might be considered in place of DAT 281.]

**Credits:** 3 (Skills Lab Hours)

**Terms:** Spring only

**Pre-requisites:** DAT 129 or DAT 204

## Description

This course equips students with hands-on experience designing, implementing and sharing a data-based inquiry project. While fluency in computer-based number crunching remains an essential skill set of a data practitioner, project success also hinges on effective problem scoping with clients and thoughtful packaging of technical results for applicability in the clientâ€™s work context. To develop these supplemental project skills, this course invites students to experiment with a variety of qualitative research strategies for unearthing foundational client concerns from among peripheral organizational clutter.


## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of the course, the student will:
1. Demonstrate the ability to discover foundational client concerns using qualitative research techniques such as semi-structured interviewing, workflow walkthroughs, focus groups and workplace observation.
2. Prepare a data research project plan aligned to client concerns for implementation by a workgroup.
3. Implement a data research project using an industry standard project management framework.
4. Present formally the results of a substantial research inquiry with the project client.
5. Evaluate the outcomes of a data research project against initial project aims in consultation with a client.
