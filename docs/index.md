## Sample lessons for self-paced exploration (or review)

* [Learn the command line interface](https://github.com/ccac-data-analytics/learn-cli) - A lesson we go through in Python 1, to help people navigate the command line for the first time
* [Learn GitHub](https://github.com/ccac-data-analytics/learn_github) - This lesson was put together quickly in Spring 2020 (at the start of the pandemic), to help DAT 201 students on disparate systems, attending courses remotely, learn how to use GitHub. It's intended as a _second_ GitHub lesson, but should be followable by a first-time GitHub user.
* [Pandas Data Wrangling](https://github.com/ccac-data-analytics/pandas_data_wrangling) - A second-level Pandas lesson for students who have seen a Pandas introduction in the past. We use this lesson in DAT 202.
