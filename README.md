# The CCAC Data Analytics GitHub.io page

[This page](https://ccac-data-analytics.github.io) serves as a space for the Data Analytics faculty to collate and share information about the Data Analytics program at CCAC.

Right now its most important function is to communicate curriculum changes that have been approved for Fall 2021, until the Catalog is updated to reflect those changes.

We will also post announcements here and in the program's Slack workspace.
